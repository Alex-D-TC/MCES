pan: ltl formula p3

(Spin Version 6.4.8 -- 2 March 2018)
	+ Partial Order Reduction

Full statespace search for:
	never claim         	+ (p3)
	assertion violations	+ (if within scope of claim)
	acceptance   cycles 	+ (fairness disabled)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by never claim)

State-vector 80 byte, depth reached 38, errors: 0
       29 states, stored (58 visited)
       46 states, matched
      104 transitions (= visited+matched)
        0 atomic steps
hash conflicts:         0 (resolved)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.003	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    0.284	actual memory usage for states
  128.000	memory used for hash table (-w24)
    0.534	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)

ltl p1: ((gsState==1)) U ((gsState==0))
ltl p2: ((osState==1)) U ((osState==0))
ltl p3: (<> (((gsState==1)) && ((osState==0)))) U ((gsState==0))
  the model contains 3 never claims: p3, p2, p1
  only one claim is used in a verification run
  choose which one with ./pan -a -N name (defaults to -N p1)
  or use e.g.: spin -search -ltl p1 hello.pml
